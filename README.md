#React Redux Typescript

Small React project to use Redux with Typescript

#Create as a TS project from start:

Migration for a JS react app is painful becase types and tsconfig aren't created automatically. Best to use the TS template.

```
$ yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

##Using Redux with TS (yarn v1):

```
$ yarn -v

> prints yarn version

$ npx yarn-deduplicate --packages @types/react
```
